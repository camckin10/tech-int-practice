	<h2>Welcome to Tech Interview Practice!</h2>
	<h3>These problems are from <a href="http://www.r-5.org/files/books/computers/overviews/cs-tools/Brian_Hogan-Exercises_for_Programmers-EN.pdf">"Exercises from Programmers."</a> I used Python3 and Vanilla JS to solve these problems.</h3>

	<hr>

	<section class="question-1">
		<h4>Question #1</h4>
	 <p>Hello World--create a problem that prompts for your name and prints a greeting using your name. 
	 CONSTRAINT:Keep input, string interpolation, and output separate. 
	 EXAMPLE OUTPUT: 
	 What is your name? Bob
	 Hello Bob, nice to meet you.</p>

	 <p>SOLUTION:(using python3):
	 name = "Chelsey"  
	 input_name = input("What is your name?")
	 print("Hello" + " "+ name + " " + ",nice to meet you.")
	 </p>
	</section>

	<section class="question-2">
	<h4>Question #2</h4>
	<p>Counting Number of Characters--Create a program that prompts for an input string and displays output that shows input string and the number of characters the string contains. 
	EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
	What is the input string? Homer
	Homer has 5 characters
	CONSTRAINTS:
	1.output must contain original string
	2.use single output statement to construct the output
	3.use built in function of programming language to determine length of string. 
	</p>

	<p>SOLUTION(using Python3):
		word = "pickle"
		string_question = input("What is input string?")
		print(word + " " + "has" + " " + str(len(str))+ " " + "characters")
	</p>
	</section>

	<section class= "question-3">
	<h4>Question #3</h4>
	<p>Create a program that prompts for a quote and an author.
	Display the quotation and author shown in the example output.</p>
	<p>Example output: 
			What is the quote? Lisa I'm home! 
			Who said it? A comedian
			A comedian says, "Lisa I'm home!"</p>
			<p>Constraints:
			Use a single output statement to produce this output using appropriate string escape techniques.
			Don't use string interpolation/string substitution.</p>
				<hr>
			<p>Here is the code:</p>
			<p>What is your name? <input id="one"></p>
			<p>Who said it? <input id="two"></p>
			<button id="submit">Submit Answer</button>

			<hr>

			<div id = "answer"></div>
